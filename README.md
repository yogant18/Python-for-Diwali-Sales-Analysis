Analyzing the Diwali sales data so that we can improve customer experience and sales

## Diwali Sales Data Analysis 
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of Diwali sales data to uncover key trends and insights. My goal was to understand customer purchasing behavior to help drive business decisions, enhance customer experience, and boost revenue for future sales events.

## Project Overview:
I took a raw dataset of Diwali sales and navigated the entire data analysis lifecycle. This involved everything from cleaning and preprocessing the data to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing my findings. The final output is a detailed report with actionable insights into customer demographics, popular product categories, and sales performance across different states.

## Key Findings & Insights
### My analysis revealed several key patterns:

Demographics: The majority of buyers are married women in the 26-35 age group.

Geographic Trends: States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka showed the highest sales figures.

Top Product Categories: The most popular product categories were Food, Clothing & Apparel, and Electronics & Gadgets.

Occupational Insights: Customers from IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors were the top spenders.
